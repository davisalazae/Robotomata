# Robotomata
This was a group project for my CPSC 4112 Games Programming 2 and CPSC 4113 Game Jam courses. I was responsible primarily as the modeler and also tested for bugs. Shawn Jones and Nicholaus Smith were the main programmers for the project. Trevon Harris created the ui and also added sound effects. This was programmed in VS utilizing C# and developed using Unity and Blender.
